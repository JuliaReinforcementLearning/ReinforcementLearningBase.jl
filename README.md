This package defines two core concepts in reinforcement learning:

- `AbstractEnv`. Checkout [ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningEnvironments.jl) for versatile varieties of environments.
- `AbstractPolicy`.
  [ReinforcementLearningCore.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearningCore.jl)
  is a good start point for how to write customized policies.
